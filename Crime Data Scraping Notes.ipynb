    "- We want to do this step in python rather than by hand since there are potentially many files form which we can extract the data. Doing so in a batch format would be ideal and the most replicable.\n",
    "- The first python module I found is [`tabula`-py](https://github.com/chezou/tabula-py). It has a function `convert_into_by_batch()` which converts every file in a directory into CSV format.\n",
