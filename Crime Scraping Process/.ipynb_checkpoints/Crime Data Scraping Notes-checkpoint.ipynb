    "- If we can get the files as a simple text, then we can use regular expressions and the like to more easily parse out the data.\n",
    "- We want to do this step in python rather than by hand since there are potentially many files form which we can extract the data. Doing so in a batch format would be ideal and the most replicable.\n",
    "- The first python module I found is [`tabula`-py](https://github.com/chezou/tabula-py). It has a function `convert_into_by_batch()` which converts every file in a directory into CSV format.\n",
    "    - Tabula-py is a wrapper for a java program. To get this to work, java must already be installed.\n",
    "    - Install from command line with `pip install tabula-py`"
